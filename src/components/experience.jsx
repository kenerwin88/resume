						Chief Architect of Infrastructure @ KAR Global{" "}
						<small className="date">September 2018 - June 2020</small>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Driving innovation and modernization efforts across all KAR Global
						infrastructure. Responsible for the design and implementation of
						overall tech strategy and roadmap for multiple lines of business
						(hosted both on-prem and public cloud). Actively fostering a
						cultural shift from legacy IT practices to a DevOps mindset
						(cross-collaboration, SREs not sysadmins, removing silos, focus on
						continuous improvement).
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<b>Accomplishments:</b>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Stabilized a freshly acquired line of business that had not
							successfully released code in over a year, with very high
							turnover. Over a four month period, I served as a combined remote
							manager, scrum master, product owner, and IC for the SRE teams. We
							were able to not only release new code successfully, but drop
							deployment cycles down to a weekly cadence. I mentored the team,
							teaching them how to follow Agile practices, and how to use proper
							tooling to manage the infrastructure, resulting in improved morale
							and reduced turnover.
						</li>
						<li>
							Migrated legacy EAP JBOSS applications from VMware to Kubernetes,
							with full CI/CD, utilizing Azure DevOps pipelines to deploy Helm
							charts to K8s.
						</li>
						<li>
							Built highly available on-prem Kubernetes (OpenShift) clusters for
							latency sensitive workloads, and public cloud (EKS) clusters for
							scalability.
						</li>
						<li>
							Created automated cluster build scripts, we were able to
							successfully migrate production workloads to a new cluster with
							zero downtime. (Utilizing Velero for the actual backup/restore,
							and flipping VIPs after passing liveness checks).
						</li>
						<li>
							Reduced overall annual expenses substantially by rightsizing our
							cloud footprint, and standardizing on tools.

					<h3>
						Senior Manager of Automation @ Salesforce{" "}
						<small className="date">Dec 2016 - September 2018</small>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Leading Infrastructure & Development automation efforts across
						Salesforce, through declarative data, configuration management, and
						continuous integration.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<b>Accomplishments:</b>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Built & managed a team of 9 rockstar direct reports, as well as
							providing tools and guidance for all other infrastructure teams.
						</li>
						<li>
							Architected & Implemented Jenkins for all teams to consume (used
							for automated testing, continuous integration, and declarative
							data pipelines).
						</li>
						<li>
							Automated deployment of physical SQL clusters, deploying over 400
							in a few hours. (automated iLO, BIOS configuration, IPs reserved
							in IPAM, NICs teamed & tagged, WWNs gathered for storage, OS
							deployed, patched (including firmware), configured via Chef,
							clustered, LUNs mounted, & SQL installed.)
						</li>
						<li>
							Declarative Data - Under my direction, my team created a
							declarative data REST API. All of the data within is generated
							automatically, & is automatically validated. This was the first
							declarative data initiative within Salesforce MC, and has served
							as an early model for other teams looking to adopt declarative
							data.
						</li>
						<li>
							Standardized Images - Used Packer to automate the creation of a
							standard set of OS images, with an identical image created for
							deploying to VMware, Virtualbox, and MAAS (for physical
							deployments). This has made it possible to quickly iterate and
							test on the exact same image thatâ€™s deployed in all 3 scenarios.
							Our Server 2016 image is now the 4th most popular image for Vagrant
							on Atlas.
						</li>
						<li>
							Automated deployment of application servers utilizing Chef for
							configuration management & Terraform for provisioning.
						</li>

						<li>
							Created REST API for declarative data, used to simplify and
							automate builds across OS, storage, networking, and application
							teams.
